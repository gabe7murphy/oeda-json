Department of Defense News Transcript Press Briefing Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby 7 January 2014 Daily Press Briefing Q: Can you tell us what the U.S. military is doing to prepare for any possible attack, any contingency around the Sochi Games?  There's been a lot of focus on potential terrorism and perhaps an evacuation plan that the U.S. military would be involved in.  Are ships underway?  What's -- what's happening?

SENTENCE:
I would really kind of rather leave it at that, we're looking at what assets we have in the area and what might be available for use.  I know there have been press reporting out there that -- that a couple of ships will be in the Black Sea, and in that area during the time of the Olympics.  That's true.  They are not in the Black Sea now.  I don't want to get ahead of ship's movements or talk about specific schedules, but it is true there will be a couple of ships in the Black Sea.

There's been, no specific planning for evacuation.  There's been no request to have a plan to do that right now.  As you know, the evacuation of American citizens is always done in concert with and at the request of the United States State Department, and there is no such request like that for that at all.  This is simply a military commander doing what military commanders are supposed to do, and that's to be thinking ahead, just in case.
